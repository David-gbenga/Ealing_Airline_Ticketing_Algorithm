The goal of this project is to develop a ticketing airline web application system for Ealing Airways. 
One of the major highlight of this project is developing an optimized ticketing platform which enables low cost options. 
Customers will be able to purchase tickets online for flights of their choice and avail themselves of various other facilities. 
For the development of this application, I was asked to use a plan-driven development approach. Plan-driven development is a sequential process that includes all the phases of the software development life cycle. 
The goal of this project is to develop an application based on customer-given requirements, by analyzing and implementing them. The scope of this assessment includes producing an algorithm that helps optimize seat allocation to minimize single seat scattering within the aircraft.
